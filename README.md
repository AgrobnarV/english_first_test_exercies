Exercise 1:
Passage A:
The Notting Hill Carnival is one of the world’s largest street festivals. It is held in the Notting Hill area of West London. Over one million people attend the carnival, which takes place over three days every August. The event started in 1966 as a celebration of Caribbean culture, with people from the West Indies, who had immigrated to London, organizing the festival. Nowadays, the event is very multi-cultural and people from all the different communities of London come together at the festival. However, the music, costumes, floats and food still have a strong Caribbean influence.

Exercise 2:
Hi Danny,
I've been thinking about the advice you gave me last night. I think you’re right. I should really make a few changes in my life. If I try and change everything at once it will be just like before. I’ll probably give up and return to my old routine and bad habits. So, first I’m going to just focus on three things: coffee, lunch and walking.
So, these are the changes I’m going to make from tomorrow. I’m going to stop taking sugar in my coffee. I’ve been having about ten teaspoons of sugar each day, so that will make a difference. And I’m going to start taking my lunch to university. I eat way too many pies and chips every week! And I’m going to walk to lectures from now on, no matter how bad the weather is. I’ve got a coat so I’m going to use it. I’m going to stop using the weather as an excuse for taking the bus all the time. And I’m finished with elevators. None of my lectures are higher than three flights of steps. I’m going to think of my heavy bag as weight training. 
I imagine I’ll feel much better this time next month, and it’ll be easy for me to make some more changes then.
Wish me luck!
Your friend, Tomo

Exercise 3:
So, you want to run your first marathon? These tips may help you succeed. 
First, you’ll need a training plan. Most experts say you should be running consistently for at least a year before attempting a marathon. Running a few shorter races can help you understand how to pace yourself for the real thing. You must buy quality running shoes, lightweight running clothes, a wristwatch and a reliable water pack. You might also consider buying sunglasses or a sunhat.
Next, preparing yourself mentally is just as important as building your physical strength. Instead of complaining about the weather or criticizing the running course, focus on your thoughts. Everyone feels too tired to go on at some point during a marathon. Your determination to keep running is completely in your control!
You will also need a strategy for race day. The day before your big race, eat nutritious food that has worked for you in training. On the day of the race, you should begin about an hour before the race with stretching and slower-paced running. During the race, find a group going your speed and run with them. The group can shelter you from any headwinds and help you keep on your pace. 
Finally, you need to choose your marathon. If you want to run in a famous race like the New York or London Marathon, you’ll need to have completed a previous marathon under a certain time. The best runners have times just over two hours, but your time can be quite a bit slower than this and still qualify you for the race.

(Runners who drop out of a marathon near the finish line are as physically fit as the runners who finish the race | Runners who train for mental stamina do not need to do as much physical training | Runners with marathon race experience are mentally better prepared than runners who have no experience | Runners who run in a group are less tired and discouraged than those who run alone.)
5. What should runners do to warm up for the race? (Fill up their water packs and check their shoes | Stretch their muscles and run slowly | run several quick miles | plan a pace for the race)
